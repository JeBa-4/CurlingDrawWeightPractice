## 16. User Story Based Development Approach

### 16.1 User Story Workflow
1. **Customer/Product Owner** provides initial user stories to the UX Designer
2. **UX Designer (AI)** creates wireframes and design concepts based on user stories
3. **Project Manager (AI)** creates corresponding backlog items in GitHub Projects
4. **Data Architect (AI)** defines data structures needed for the user stories
5. **Fullstack Programmer (AI)** implements the features based on designs and architecture
6. **Test Manager (AI)** creates automated tests for the implemented features
7. **DevOps Engineer (AI)** ensures smooth deployment of completed features
8. **Security Specialist (AI)** reviews implementations for security considerations

### 16.2 User Story Format
User stories will follow the standard format:
```
As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit/value].
```

Additional details may include:
- Acceptance criteria
- Priority level
- Any specific UI/UX considerations
- Technical constraints or requirements

### 16.3 Initial Backlog Creation Process
1. Product Owner provides user stories to UX Designer
2. UX Designer collaborates with Product Owner to refine stories
3. Project Manager creates GitHub issues from refined user stories
4. Team prioritizes issues in the backlog
5. Development begins with highest priority items

### 16.4 Continuous Backlog Refinement
- AI agents will suggest additional user stories based on existing ones
- Product Owner reviews and approves suggested stories
- Backlog is continuously re-prioritized based on feedback and insights
- New requirements are added as user stories throughout the development lifecycle

This approach ensures that all development is centered around user needs while leveraging AI agents to accelerate the process from user story to implemented feature.

## 17. Test-Driven Development Approach

The project will follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices to ensure high quality and adherence to requirements.

### 17.1 TDD Process
- Tests are written before implementation code
- Implementation follows to make tests pass
- Code is refactored while maintaining passing tests

### 17.2 Testing Workflow
1. Create test cases from user stories
2. Write automated tests before implementation
3. Implement code to pass tests
4. Verify all tests pass before merging

### 17.3 Testing Tools
- Jest for JavaScript testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

This TDD approach will ensure all features meet requirements and maintain high quality.

## 21. AI Agent Workflow and Interaction Model

### 21.1 AI Agent Responsibilities
- Each AI agent will maintain awareness of the entire project documentation
- AI agents will follow the Project Plan, understand their role-specific responsibilities
- AI agents will track ticket information and assignments in GitHub Projects
- All documentation generated will be considered authoritative by all AI agents
- AI agents will collaborate seamlessly to ensure project continuity

### 21.2 Interaction Model
- **Single Chat Window Approach**: All AI agent interactions will occur through a single chat window
- You (as Customer/Product Owner) can direct messages to specific roles by beginning your message with the role name, e.g., "UX Designer: [your message]"
- The AI will context-switch to the appropriate role and respond accordingly
- This eliminates the need to switch between different chat windows for different roles

### 21.3 Role Transition Protocol
1. Address the specific role you want to interact with
2. The AI will acknowledge the role change
3. The AI agent will have full context of prior conversations and project documentation
4. You can switch back to the Project Manager or any other role at any time

### 21.4 Project Memory and Continuity
- All AI agents share a collective understanding of the project status
- Work performed by one AI agent is immediately understood by others
- Project documentation serves as the single source of truth
- GitHub Issues and the Kanban board provide ongoing task tracking

### 21.5 Example Interaction
```
You: "UX Designer: I need wireframes for the main training screen."
AI: [As UX Designer] "I'll create those wireframes based on our earlier discussions about the training functionality..."
You: "Data Architect: What database structure will support this training screen?"
AI: [As Data Architect] "Based on the wireframes being developed, we'll need the following data models..."
```

### 21.6 Getting Started
To begin the project:
1. Set up the GitHub repository as outlined in section 15
2. Address the Project Manager to coordinate initial activities
3. Provide user stories to the UX Designer to begin the design process
4. The Test Manager will create test cases based on these user stories
5. Development will proceed following the TDD approach outlined in section 17

Follow this interaction model throughout the project lifecycle to seamlessly work with all AI agents.
