# Test Strategy - CurlingDrawWeightPractice

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the CurlingDrawWeightPractice application. It defines the overall testing approach, methodologies, frameworks, and processes that will be used to ensure the application's quality and reliability.

## 1. Test Strategy Overview

### 1.1 Testing Mission

The testing mission for the CurlingDrawWeightPractice application is to:

- Ensure the application accurately records and analyzes curling shot data
- Verify the application provides an intuitive and responsive mobile-first experience
- Validate all features work correctly across supported browsers and devices
- Confirm the application functions reliably in both online and offline modes
- Ensure multilingual support (English and Finnish) works correctly throughout the application
- Verify that the microservices architecture meets performance and reliability requirements

### 1.2 Test Driven Development Approach

As outlined in the project plan, this project follows a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach:

1. Create test cases directly from user stories and acceptance criteria
2. Write automated tests before implementing any code
3. Implement code to pass the tests
4. Refactor code while maintaining passing tests
5. Repeat for all features and enhancements

This TDD approach ensures that:
- All requirements have corresponding tests
- All code is testable by design
- Test coverage is comprehensive
- Regression issues are minimized

### 1.3 Key Quality Attributes

The following quality attributes will be prioritized throughout testing:

- **Functional Correctness**: The application must accurately record, calculate, and display shot data
- **Usability**: The interface must be intuitive and efficient for curling players
- **Performance**: The application must be responsive with minimal load times
- **Reliability**: The application must function consistently and predictably
- **Compatibility**: The application must work on all supported browsers and devices
- **Offline Capability**: Core functionality must work without network connectivity
- **Data Integrity**: User data must be stored securely and accurately
- **Localization**: All content must be properly displayed in supported languages

### 1.4 Testing Metrics

The following metrics will be tracked to assess testing effectiveness:

- Test coverage (aim for >90% code coverage)
- Number of automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Test execution time
